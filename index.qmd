## Background

[LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/index.php) products are extremely useful for natural resource managers, allowing users to complete many tasks, including these that are featured in this website:

![Historical ecosystems map.](images/bps.jpg){style="float:right; margin-left: 25px;" fig-alt="\"Historical ecosystems map of a large region in the western United States." fig-align="right" width="250" }

* Mapping and quantifying historical ecosystems (see map below made with [LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings data](https://landfire.gov/bps.php))
* Mapping and quantifying existing vegetation type, height and cover
* Comparing reference and current amounts of ecosystem succession classes


While useful, effectively working with LANDFIRE products can be intimidating due to terminology, GIS processing and data wrangling often required.

Additionally, the "fire-hose" of information can pose a problem. Where is a user to start?

## Goals

Often a good way to start learning something is to jump in and take on a meaningful project. Here we show you how to take a shapefile of your area of interest, then:

* Download and process multiple LANDFIRE datasets
* Bring LANDFIRE data into ArcGIS pro, explore ways to make maps that follow Universal Design principles (i.e., easier for everyone to read)
* Quantify and make charts of attributes of interest
* Understand the basics of Biophysical Settings and Models
